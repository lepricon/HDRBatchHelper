The aim of the project is to batch operations of creation of HRD images using
aligning and tone mapping usign ImageMagic tools.

The GUI helps you to choose images and allign them in the stack. The stacks
are added to the queue which is passed to ImageMagic toolchain for processing.
Load balancing is applied so that not more that N ( = 3 currently) threads
are processing the queue at time.

Eclipse is main development platform.
