The aim of the project is to batch operations of HRD images creation with 
help of aligning and tone mapping usign Enblend/Enfuse tools
(http://enblend.sourceforge.net/). Both must be installed, along with 
ImageMagic tools.

The GUI helps you to choose images and allign them in the stack. The stacks
are added to the queue which is passed to ImageMagic toolchain for processing.
Load balancing is applied so that not more that N ( = 3 currently) threads
are processing the queue at time.
